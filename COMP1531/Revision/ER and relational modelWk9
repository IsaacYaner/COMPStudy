Example:
    If has favorite team, player, it can bee a relationship
    Captian is a kind of relationship
Good:
    high level
    good expressive power

Relational data model
    general data frmalism
    map to file structure
    Relation -- table
    tuple -- row
    attribute -- column
        belongs to a domain which has name, type and format
    Relation schema:
        R(an:Dn, ...)
    Tuple:
        DnXDn
    Instance:
        Set of Tuple
    schema --versus-- Instance
    Degree (arity)
        number of attributes
    Constrains:
        defines
            values are/not allowed
            combinations are/not
        DO
            domain constraint
                NULL satisfies all domain constraints
            key constraint
                (Uniqueness constraint)
                one candidate is designated a primary key
                No primary key can be NULL
            referential constraint
                Foreign key -- Primary key in parent table
                    either all Primary key of others or all NULL
                Cuz domain must be atomic
                arrow points to parent's Primary key
    A relational database schema
        set of relation schemas && integrity constraints

RDM vs DBMS
    RDM
        mathematical construct
            representation of data structures
            constraints of relation/tuples
            algebra for manipulating
    DBMS
        implementation
        SQL as language
Mapping
    optimised:
        merge 1 factor to the N
        1 - 1 also do that
        Multi valued store that in a new relation that holds a key to 1
ORM
    transfer data
    shield from writing SQL and focus on app logic
