## Learning

+ Supervised learning
  + need label
  + easy to build

## Model

+ Geometric 
+ Probability
+ Logical

### Characterised by properties

+ Regression
+ Classification
+ Neural networks
+ Local models
+ Tree-based
+ Ensemble

### Regression

#### Square error

+ Sum of Square of Error

#### Probability vs Statistics

+ Deductive
+ Inductive

#### Hypothesis

+ Inductive learning hypothesis
  + Sufficiently large set->represent whole population

#### Univariate

$b=\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}$
b is the gradient

#### Multivariate

+ Regularisation
  + Shrinkage


## Mathematics

$\hat b = \frac{\bar {xy}-\bar x - \bar y}{\bar {x^2} - {\bar x}^2}$
