class Factor:
    '''
    Factors are a generalisation of discrete probability distributions over one or more random variables.
    Each variable must have a name (which may be a string or integer).
    The domain of the factor specifies which variables the factor operates over.
    The outcomeSpace specifies which 
    
    
    The probabilities are stored in a n-dimensional numpy array, using the domain and outcomeSpace
    as dimension and row labels respectively.

        This function allows direct access to individual probabilities.
        E.g. if the factor represents a joint distribution over variables 'A','B','C','D', each with outcomeSpace [0,1,2],
        then `factor[0,1,0,2]` will return the probability that the four variables are set to 0,1,0,2 respectively.
        
        The outcomes used for indexing may also be strings. If in the example above the outcomeSpace of each variable is
        ['true','false'], then `factor['true','false','true','true']` will return the probability that 
        A='true', B='false', C='true' and D='true'.
