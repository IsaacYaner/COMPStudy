# Introduction

## Keywords

+ Probabilistic Graphical Models (**PGMS**)
+ Degree of Belief (DB)

## Automated Reasoning

+ Knowledge Base (model-based system)
  + In probabilistic reasoning
    + KB is a Graphical Model
      + Bayesian Network
    + Inference engine
      + Laws of probability theory

## Monotomic Logic

+ Deductive logic is monotonic
  + Can't assert and retract assumptions
  +  common-sense reasoning
+ Non-monotonic logics
  + Can manage assumptions
  + Degree of beliefðŸ‘‡

## Degree of Belief

+ Notion of probability calculus

### Decision Theory

+ Cost of decision
+ Rewards and penalties

### Probability

+ **Objective** Frequencies
+ **Subjective** degrees of belief

## Probabilistic Reasoning

### Criticism

+ **Cognitive:**
  + Human don't use DB
    + In the aspect of imitating human
+ **Pragmatic:**
  + Availability of DB
    + expert elicitation
  + Robustness
+ **Computational:**
  + Scale
  + Joint probability distribution grows exponentially with variables.

## Bayesian network

+ **Graphical Model**
+ Represent large size distribution
+ Polytree, jointree to handle arbitrary networks
+ consistency and completeness are ensured using direct local tests only
+ None of these probabilities are part of the network (Implied)

#### Learning

+ Maximum likelihood
+ Bayesian approach (prior)

## Graphical model

### Properties

+ **Directed** or **undirected**
  + undirected -> symmetric
+ **Static** or **dynamic**
  + time matters
+ **Probabilistic** or **decisional**
  + decisional include **random** and **utility** variables
