        Only one class can exist and must be the first one.

Generic<Child> is not a subtype of Generic<Base>
They are in the same level

Wild card can be used in parameters <? extends Something> or <? super Something> or just <?>

A more strict class can inherite a wild card class, but Dont' forget it's not for Generic without wildcard.
