What is abstract class or method?
Design smell
    is Poor Design
    Include
        Rigidity
            difficult to change
        Fragility
            change cause many breaks
        Immobility
            hard to reuse
        Viscosity
            hack to change or slow environment
        Needless complexity
            unuseful constructs, ahead requirement
        Needless repetition
            bugs fixed repeatly

Design principle
    Characteristed by
        Coupling
        Cohesion
    loose coupling and high Cohesion
        Extensible
        Reusable
        teatable
        Maintanable
        Understandable
    SOLID
        SRP
            single responsibility
                avoid unnecessary couplings
                change in res may impair ability to meet others
            Violation
                Mixing business logic
                Grouping business rules and persistence control
            If no symptom to change, don't split too hard
            Read Reuse Test
        OCP
            open closed principle
                Open for extension, closed for modification
            reduces rigidity
            Bad
                Not Easy
                Expensive
        LSP
            Liskov substitution principle
        ISP
            Interface segregation
        DIP
            Dependency invertion
    MVC 
        Model View Controller
        Multiple presentation of data
