Weigh(3^n coins, Pile):
    if n is 1, this Pile(only contains 1 coin) is the counterfeit.
    split Pile into three equal piles: n-n-n
    weigh two of them
        if equal, the remaining is the lilghter pile
    Weigh(n, lighter pile)

27: Needs log3(27) = 3 times.

for 12:
    Split into 4 parts
    weigh two of them
    then get two equal piles:(If equal, get them. If not, the remaining two are.)
        that each contains 3.
    Join one pile in the equal into the other two to form a new Pile which contains 9 coins.
    Weigh(9, Pile):
        Inherit:
        compare the all real pile to the lighter pile, if equal, the fake should be heavier.
            else, it's lighter.
    
12: Needs 1+log3(9) = 3 times.

(9, 3):
for 9, with 3 fake:
    Split into 4 piles containing 2 coins and 1 single coin.
    compare 2 piles.
        if equal, compare two coins in one of the two piles:
            if equal, these 2 piles must be all real, then do (5, 3)::2 steps taken
            if not: get one fake, then comare another pile to get another fake, then do (5, 1)::3 steps taken
        if not, compare two coins in the heavier pile: 
            if one is heavier, get one fake, and the other pile is all real, then do (5, 2)::2 steps taken
            if equal, get two fake, and the other pile
