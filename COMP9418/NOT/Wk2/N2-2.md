# Baysian Networks 2

## Keywords

+ Query
+ MAP/MPE

### Qeuries

+ Probability

#### Probability of evidence $P(\bold e)$

+ $E$ are evidence variables
+ $P(X\lor Y)$ is achieved by define E by $X\lor Y$
  + **Auxiliary-node method**

#### Prior Marginal $P(\bold x)$

+ without evidence 

#### Posterior Marginal $P(\bold x |\bold e)$

+ **Marginal** is smaller set of variables

#### Most probable explanation (MPE)

+ Find $\bold x$ with highest $P(\bold x|\bold e)$
  + $\bold x$ is called ***maximum a posteriori hypothesis*** (MAP)
  + MPE is MAP with all variables

### Naive Bayes

+ $C->A_1,...,A_m$
  + **Class** to **attributes**
+ ***single fault*** assumption
+ Attributes are independent

#### Granularity

+ If $X$ is not query or evidence variable, it can be bypassed when it has single child.

### Dynamic Bayesian networks

### Reliability block diagram (RBD)

#### Noisy-or



## Question

+ difference between probability evidence and marginal queries?
