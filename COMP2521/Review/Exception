throw and catch(handle)
    When an exception is thrown, the run-time system would search the call stack to find a handler to catch.

Three kinds of exceptions:
    Checked exception
    Error
    Run-time exception

All exceptions should be a child of Throwable

Inheritance:
    subclass can't throw more.
