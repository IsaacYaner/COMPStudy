# KnowRep

+ The knowledge level
+ Knowledge Representation
+ Ontologies, Taxonoy, Categories and Objects
+ Semantic Networks
+ Rule based representation
+ Inference Networks
+ Deduction, Abduction and Induction

## Knowledge Level

**Hypothesis**:

&emsp;Lying above the symbol level, characterised by **knowledge** as **medium** and **principle of rationality** as **law of behaviour**.
+ Knowledge
  + Anything used to computed according to POR
+ Principle of Rationality
  + If agend has knowledge that action lead to goals, then select this action
+ Knowledge Representation
  + Expressing knowledge explicitly in a computer-tractable way
+ Reasoning
  + Use the knowledge to draw inferences.

### Knowledge-based agent

+ Core **knowledge base**
  + set of **sentences**
    + facts or non-facts

## Ontologies

organise everything into a hierarchy of categories

## Taxonomy

## Categories and Objects and FOL

## Semantic networks and description logics

### Semantic Networks

Fact, Objects, Attributes and Relationships
Associative = semantic network

Fact can be static or transient, not necessary to be permanent

#### Main Components

+ Lexical
  + Node, Link and Label
+ Structural
  + From a directed diagram
+ Semantic
+ Procedural part
  + Constructors and deconstructors

#### Reasoning

+ Frames
+ Agents
+ Objects

## Rule Based Systems

+ Production rule
  + if _ then _
  + More like natural language
+ Uncertainty
  + Uncertain evidence
  + Uncertain link between evidence and conclusion
    + Bayesian inference
  + Vague rule
    + Fuzzy logic

## Inference Networks

**Closed** world where nothing is known beyond its boundaries

Can be constructed by

+ Taking facts
+ Conditions of true
+ Add to diagram and link by logical expression
+ Breaking complex logic into small parts

## Deduction, abduction and induction

+ Deduction
  + Given cause, find the effect
+ Abduction
  + Given effect, find the cause
+ Induction
  + Given examples, find the rules
