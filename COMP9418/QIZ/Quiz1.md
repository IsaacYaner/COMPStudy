# Quiz 1

## Question 1

&emsp;Given the sentences $\alpha = \lnot A \implies \lnot B$ and $\beta = (A\lor \lnot B \lor C) \land (A \lor \lnot B \lor \lnot C)$, is $\alpha$ and $\beta$ equivalent?

&emsp;Yes, as $\lnot A \implies \lnot B = A\lor \lnot B$, then $\beta = (\alpha \lor C)\land(\alpha \lor \lnot C)$

## Question 2

&emsp;Is $A\implies B \implies (\lnot B \implies \lnot A)$ valid?

&emsp;Yes, as $A\implies B \iff (\lnot B \implies \lnot A)$ 

## Question 3

Given joint distribution table and calculate Probability of A,B,C separately.

## Question 4
