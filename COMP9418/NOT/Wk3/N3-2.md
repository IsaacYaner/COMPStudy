# Variable Elimination

## Summing out

## Elimination order

### Width

+ number of variables of largest factor ever



## Interaction graph

+ Variables in a factor are interconnected
+ Another way to visualise the interaction graph is to realise that the variables of factor form a clique.

### Observations

+ after elimination - see slides

## Structure and complexity

### Treewidth

+ Minimum width equals to treewidth
+ Number of parents (minimum treewidth)

#### Polytrees networks

+ Singly connected networks
+ At most one path between any two nodes
+ $k = MAX parents$

##### Tree networks

+ $k = 1$

#### Multiply connected

### Prunning

+ Remove irrelavent nodes
+ Remove all edges starting from evidence

### BUcket elimination

## Question 

+ How to calculate treewidth
