## Classification outline

+ inductive bias
+ Bayes Theorem
+ MAP ML
+ Bayes optimal classification rule
+ Naive Bayes
+ Naive Bayes for text classification
+ logistic regression 

## Inductive bias

+ assumptions and restrictions on the models

### Decision Rule

&emsp;Predict Y on the basis of X

## MAP ML

+ Maximum a posterior hypothesis
  + Find max P(h|D)
+ Maximum Likelihood
  + Find max P(D|h)
  + assume $P(h_i) = P(h_j)$

### Minimum Description Length 

+ Optimal code
  + $-log_2p$
+ MDL
  + $h_{MDL}=argmin L_{C_1}(h)+L{C_2}(D|h)$

## Question

+ What is nearest Neighbour
+ Version Space?
+ prior/posterior distribution
+ biased towards?
